Peptide Classification, Variant Analysis, and Spectral Matching | Python, NumPy, scikit-learn, Biopython, Clustal Omega

Developed a program to classify peptide sequences as biologically “natural” or shuffled using k-mer frequency scoring and custom ML-based metrics, achieving high confidence separation via statistical and learned features.
Extracted receptor-binding domain (RBD) sequences from SARS-CoV-2 variants using NCBI and performed multiple sequence alignment to analyze mutational differences from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain.
Implemented a peptide-spectrum matching pipeline using cosine similarity between discretized theoretical and actual spectra, optimizing with precursor mass filtering and intensity normalization to improve identification efficiency at 1% FDR.
